# Week-1 Overview

In week-1,I was introduced to the fundamentals of Agentic AI. 
I learned how AI agents differ from normal chat systems and how they can reason,plan tasks, and use tools to achieve goals.
The focus this week was understanding:
-what an AI agent is
-how LLMs act as the brain
-how prompts influence outputs
-basics of planning and workflow


# Agentic AI Overview

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to act
autonomously in order to achieve specific goals. These systems can plan,
reason, make decisions, and execute actions without constant human input.

## Key Characteristics
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Autonomous decision-making
- Ability to use external tools
- Feedback-driven learning loops

## Difference Between Traditional AI and Agentic AI

| Traditional AI | Agentic AI |
|---------------|------------|
| Single response | Continuous reasoning |
| Prompt-based | Goal-driven |
| No memory | Memory-enabled |
| No autonomy | Autonomous actions |

Agentic AI systems are widely used in research automation, task planning,
customer support, and multi-agent collaboration.
